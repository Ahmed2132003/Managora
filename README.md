# Company OS

One platform for HR + Attendance + Payroll + Accounting + Dashboards (10–300 employees).

## Repo Structure
- `backend/` Django + DRF API
- `frontend/` React + TypeScript + Vite
- `infra/` Docker, deployment, and environment setup
- `docs/` Architecture notes and decisions

## Development Setup (Phase 1)
> Phase 1 focuses on project foundation + multi-tenant skeleton + auth.

### Requirements
- Git
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Node.js (later)
- Python (later)

## Branching
- `main`: stable releases
- `develop`: integration branch
- `feature/*`: feature branches per phase

## Decisions (Fixed)
- Multi-tenant: `Company` + `user.company_id`
- Auth: SimpleJWT
- API Docs: drf-spectacular
- Front: React TS + Vite + Router + TanStack Query
- Token storage (MVP): localStorage + refresh

## Manual E2E Payroll Script (Phase 5)
1. Create an employee and assign a salary structure with a basic salary.
2. Add a recurring allowance component to the salary structure.
3. Record attendance with late minutes and absent days for the period.
4. Create an unpaid leave request for the same period.
5. Create a loan advance with an installment amount.
6. Create a payroll period for the month.
7. Generate payroll runs for the period.
8. Verify payroll totals (earnings, deductions, net) per employee.
9. Download the payslip PNG for an employee.
10. Lock the payroll period.
11. Attempt to generate again; it should fail due to the lock.

## Notifications Integrations
- Leave workflow now supports role-based notifications on key actions:
  - Employee submits leave request → notify Manager + HR roles.
  - Manager/HR approves or rejects leave request → notify employee.
- Channels:
  - Email automation (enabled by default).
  - WhatsApp notifications (optional, enabled by environment settings).

### Backend environment variables
- `NOTIFICATIONS_EMAIL_ENABLED` (default `1`)
- `NOTIFICATIONS_WHATSAPP_ENABLED` (default `0`)
- `DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`
- `WHATSAPP_API_URL`
- `WHATSAPP_API_TOKEN`
- `WHATSAPP_SENDER_ID`

> WhatsApp delivery uses a provider webhook-style API with Bearer token auth.
